# go-emberjs

I want to play with Ember on the front end and Go on the back.  This is that fun.


## Golang setup

We will use gin to rebuild the go binary and proxy it for us so we can just write code and not stop/restart all the time.

    go get github.com/codegangsta/gin
    gin -h # confirm it works

## Ember setup

    npm install
    grunt watch # to rebuild assets
